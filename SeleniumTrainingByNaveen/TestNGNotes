           Even Automation engineers also use it.
       --- TDD Framework. Test Driven Development.
       --- along with development, design test cases simultaneously.

TestNG/JUnit - Developers and Automation Testers write unit test cases, and other test cases in a systematic way. For Java Only.
open source.
available in the form of JAR files.
It is called Java unit testing framework. (only avaliable for Java)
PHPUnit for PHP.
TestNG and Junit --- Both are Java testing framework.
Purpose --- 
Design test cases in a systematic way.
It generates very good html reports.
It gives lots of different annotations.
Define priority or sequence of test cases can be maintened in TestNG..
Dependency feature. one test case is dependent upon another test case.
Grouping also possible.
Data provider - execute same test case multiple times with diff set of data.

install TestNG in eclipse.

We don't need main method to execute our class in TestNG. TestNG will automatically execute our class. So Don't write main() method inside TestNG.
Project then Package then Class
Same Java Code we have to write inside TestNG.
TestNG provides some other features like annotaion.
Annotaion should be associated with a method.
You can give priority to your test cases. If the test case priority is 1 , then that test case will be executed 1st.
You can group your test case, many test cases will be under Title, other test cases will be under Logo etc.
